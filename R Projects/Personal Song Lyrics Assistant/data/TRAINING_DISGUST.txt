One more drink leads to another	DISGUST
There's a storm rolling in, soaking in the skin	DISGUST
I’ll just keep rolling till I’m in the dirt	DISGUST
Get ugly	DISGUST
Yeah, get ugly, baby	DISGUST
Get ugly	DISGUST
Damn, that's ugly	DISGUST
Damn, that's ugly	DISGUST
Playing dirty not clean	DISGUST
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!	DISGUST
But, if you're thinking about my baby	DISGUST
We got that concrete street skin	DISGUST
The only way I’m leavin’ is dead	DISGUST
Oh, my eyes are seein’ red	DISGUST
Double vision from the blood we’ve shed	DISGUST
