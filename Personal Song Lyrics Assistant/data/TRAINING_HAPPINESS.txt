On your love, love, on your love, love	HAPPINESS
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high	HAPPINESS
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love	HAPPINESS
Tear our t-shirts off each other	HAPPINESS
Your hands all over me	HAPPINESS
Make it right	HAPPINESS
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight	HAPPINESS
And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio	HAPPINESS
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow	HAPPINESS
Saying everything without making a sound, a cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon	HAPPINESS
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat	HAPPINESS
Oh woah, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat	HAPPINESS
You've got the fire in your eyes burning through the night	HAPPINESS
Oh, I know what you came for	HAPPINESS
So, baby, let the rain pour	HAPPINESS
I know you (just keep dancing, just keep dancing around it)	HAPPINESS
I know you (just keep dancing, just keep dancing around it)	HAPPINESS
We can just keep dancing around it	HAPPINESS
Turned my life into this country song	HAPPINESS
It's handshakes and whiskey shots, boy	HAPPINESS
You’re as smooth as Tennessee whiskey	HAPPINESS
You’re as sweet as strawberry wine	HAPPINESS
You’re as warm as a glass of brandy	HAPPINESS
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time	HAPPINESS
‘Cause I’m a traveller, oh, I’m a traveller	HAPPINESS
And I’m a traveller, oh, I’m a traveller	HAPPINESS
One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band	HAPPINESS
Guitar Hero with lightning hands	HAPPINESS
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms	HAPPINESS
They'll be helpless to your musical charms	HAPPINESS
And they'll all hold up their hands	HAPPINESS
And they'll all wanna dance	HAPPINESS
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on	HAPPINESS
Out here cruising to a backroad song	HAPPINESS
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong	HAPPINESS
Come on, come on sing along, sing along to my backroad song	HAPPINESS
Those stars need to be wished on	HAPPINESS
Your skin needs to be kissed on	HAPPINESS
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you	HAPPINESS
In your snapback	HAPPINESS
T-shirt of your favourite rock band	HAPPINESS
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans	HAPPINESS
In your snapback	HAPPINESS
In your snapback	HAPPINESS
Take as long as it takes, girl	HAPPINESS
Break on me	HAPPINESS
Put your head on my chest	HAPPINESS
Let me help you forget	HAPPINESS
Shot, for shot, for shot	HAPPINESS
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget	HAPPINESS
A night that we won't regret	HAPPINESS
So put your drink down, throw your camera up	HAPPINESS
Flip it around and snap a payback picture	HAPPINESS
I'll send it to my ex	HAPPINESS
And send them both a text saying	HAPPINESS
"We ain't going home alone tonight"	HAPPINESS
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go	HAPPINESS
Can I get a hallelujah	HAPPINESS
Can I get an amen	HAPPINESS
When I play the highway FM	HAPPINESS
I find my soul revival	HAPPINESS
Singing every single verse	HAPPINESS
Yeah I guess that’s my church	HAPPINESS
Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine	HAPPINESS
Private school daughters that never go under water keeping their hair just right	HAPPINESS
I know in September, I'm gonna remember how much I loved her	HAPPINESS
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh single for the summer	HAPPINESS
I see our friends and they put on a show	HAPPINESS
Addicted and I’m dying for a hit of your love	HAPPINESS
When the work you put in is realized	HAPPINESS
Let yourself feel the pride but	HAPPINESS
Always stay humble and kind	HAPPINESS
You’re such a beautiful drug	HAPPINESS
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand	HAPPINESS
Baby I could die a happy man yeah	HAPPINESS

Except the beat that's in my heart	HAPPINESS
Yeah, it's keeping me alive	HAPPINESS
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)	HAPPINESS
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time	HAPPINESS
Got me lifted drifting higher than the ceiling	HAPPINESS
Ooh baby it's the ultimate feeling	HAPPINESS
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted	HAPPINESS
In the night she hears him calling	HAPPINESS
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain	HAPPINESS
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face	HAPPINESS
Look me in the eyes, my lover (He-ey)	HAPPINESS
Deep in my bones, I can feel you	HAPPINESS
We could waste the night with an old film	HAPPINESS
Smoke a little weed on the couch in the back room	HAPPINESS
