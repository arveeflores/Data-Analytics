I woke up, up still drunk, drunk	SADNESS
I tell myself I’m not in love	SADNESS
But one more time is not enough	SADNESS
One last kiss and then you’re a goner	SADNESS
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer	SADNESS
Trying to take what's lost and broken	SADNESS
I know right where I went wrong	SADNESS
I know just what got her gone	SADNESS
And I got nobody to blame but me	SADNESS
I got nobody to blame but me	SADNESS
One day, you're the king, and the next, you're not	SADNESS
And throwing up in parking lots all by yourself	SADNESS
I’m just a traveller on this earth	SADNESS
Sure as my heart’s behind the pocket of my shirt	SADNESS
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood	SADNESS
Breakin' hearts like only you can	SADNESS
Shatter like glass	SADNESS
Come apart in my hands	SADNESS
When your heart needs to break	SADNESS
Just break on me	SADNESS
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop	SADNESS
Home alone tonight	SADNESS
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya	SADNESS
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough	SADNESS
I know you got moutains to climb but	SADNESS
I can’t get enough	SADNESS
Got a death wish baby, baby	SADNESS
Don’t want you to save me, save me	SADNESS
I guess that's just how it goes	SADNESS
When you break up in a small town	SADNESS
Like they don't want me to know	SADNESS
So they give me the go-around	SADNESS
But there's only so many streets, so many lights	SADNESS
I should've known all along	SADNESS
When you break up in a small town	SADNESS
Looking high and low, someone let me know	SADNESS
I’m going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh	SADNESS
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy	SADNESS
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy	SADNESS
We can't even slow down	SADNESS
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)	SADNESS
In the night when she comes crawling	SADNESS
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)	SADNESS
Hello from the other side	SADNESS
I must've called a thousand times	SADNESS
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done	SADNESS
But when I call you never seem to be home	SADNESS
Hello from the outside	SADNESS
At least I can say that I've tried	SADNESS
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart	SADNESS
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore	SADNESS
Let me photograph you in this light	SADNESS
Be exactly like we were before we realised	SADNESS
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless	SADNESS
It was just like a movie	SADNESS
It was just like a song	SADNESS
Oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?	SADNESS
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here	SADNESS
Oh baby you should go and love yourself	SADNESS
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'	SADNESS
You should go and love yourself	SADNESS
I'm sorry, yeah	SADNESS
Sorry, yeah	SADNESS
Sorry	SADNESS
Yeah I know that I let you down	SADNESS
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?	SADNESS
Take me back to a time when only we knew	SADNESS
Say you'll never let me go	SADNESS
Say you'll never let me go	SADNESS
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days	SADNESS
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out	SADNESS
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days	SADNESS
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out	SADNESS
We're stressed out	SADNESS
Low life, low life, low life	SADNESS
Know I'm repping for that low, low life	SADNESS
Said I'm repping for that low life	SADNESS
Low life, low life, low life, low life	SADNESS
I'm representing for that low life	SADNESS
Said I'm repping for that low life	SADNESS
Low life, low life, low life	SADNESS
Will you ever respect me? No	SADNESS
Do things my own way darling	SADNESS
I only call you when it's half past five	SADNESS
The only time that I'll be by your side	SADNESS
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me	SADNESS
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me	SADNESS
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah	SADNESS
I only call you when it's half past five	SADNESS
The only time I'd ever call you mine	SADNESS
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me	SADNESS
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me	SADNESS
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me,  babe	SADNESS
You used to call me on my cell phone	SADNESS
Don't say a word no, don't you talk	SADNESS
As a young ass nigga I was dead broke	SADNESS
Got young Doolie on the body and I really do miss her	SADNESS
If we tried that we could be	SADNESS
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’	SADNESS
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry	SADNESS
They ask me if I'm lying, I say "really really"	SADNESS
I'm really out my mind, I say "really really"	SADNESS
Back then I had no phone	SADNESS
The judges said don't trouble nobody	SADNESS
Probation said don't trouble nobody	SADNESS
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody	SADNESS
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody	SADNESS
If we only make up	SADNESS
If we only make up	SADNESS
Imma take your order	SADNESS
The pain ain't gonna last forever	SADNESS
When the waves are taking you under	SADNESS
Do I look stupid?	SADNESS
I'm not going to fall for none of yo' tricks no more	SADNESS
Your arrow won't pierce my skin no more	SADNESS
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover	SADNESS
But The Kid Is Not My Son	SADNESS
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son	SADNESS
There are people dying	SADNESS
If you care enough for the living	SADNESS
This Humpty Dumpty's lucky	SADNESS
He's had his fall	SADNESS
But after it all	SADNESS
You know I'm down	SADNESS
I'm down for life, loaded, reloaded	SADNESS
All I’ve got is nothing without you	SADNESS
You, you,	SADNESS
Got nothing without you	SADNESS
You, you	SADNESS
Got nothing without you	SADNESS
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up	SADNESS
I don't wanna bore you with it	SADNESS
I don't wanna bore you with it	SADNESS
But I just can't do this	SADNESS
I may be dumb but	SADNESS
Impossible-le-le, impossible-le-le	SADNESS
Impossible-le-le, Impossible	SADNESS
And my heart is broken	SADNESS
All my scars are open	SADNESS
All we had is gone now	SADNESS
For the best writer in town could not find words to say	SADNESS
How there's so many things I wanna get to know	SADNESS
I wish that I could stay but I got to go	SADNESS
I'm never so high as when I'm with you	SADNESS
I can't let you go now that I got it	SADNESS
And all I need is to be struck	SADNESS
Thunder's getting louder and louder	SADNESS
When I was so heavy	SADNESS
So drink from me, drink from me	SADNESS
When I was so thirsty	SADNESS
Ex's and oh's	SADNESS
At the expense of the death of a bachelor	SADNESS
The only way I’m leavin’ is dead	SADNESS
That’s the state of my, state of my, state of my head	SADNESS
They don’t know, where we’ve been	SADNESS
That’s the state of my, state of my, state of my head	SADNESS
Livin’ like a washed up celebrity	SADNESS
I know you need it, do you feel it?	SADNESS
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down	SADNESS
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems	SADNESS
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out	SADNESS
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems	SADNESS
Hold on	SADNESS
Hold on to me	SADNESS
Cause I'm a little unsteady	SADNESS
A little unsteady	SADNESS
I'm taking back the crown	SADNESS
Saying "If you go on, you might pass out in a drain pipe"	SADNESS
This night is heating up	SADNESS
