I couldn’t tell you honey, I don’t know	FEAR
If I never get to see the Northern lights	FEAR
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night	FEAR
You gotta move or move on	FEAR
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house	FEAR
You don't have to say nothing at all	FEAR
I've been sleepwalking	FEAR
Too close to the fire	FEAR
In this burning house	FEAR
I've been sleepwalking	FEAR
Been wandering all night	FEAR
But I ain't never leaving Nashville	FEAR
I ain't never leaving Nashville	FEAR
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?	FEAR
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?	FEAR
We don't have to go out	FEAR
We don't have to go out	FEAR
In case it is the last time that we might	FEAR
I got to do things my own way darling	FEAR
Will you ever let me	FEAR
I could've been dead	FEAR
I could've been in prison	FEAR
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?	FEAR
I'm gon' skeet off, lil nigga come catch me, catch me	FEAR
Girl if you pull up to my window	FEAR
Hold on just a little bit longer	FEAR
